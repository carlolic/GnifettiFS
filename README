- This repository contains files to run the full Stokes ice-flow model of the high-Alpine glacier saddle Colle Gnifetti, Swiss/Italian Alps, described in Licciulli et al. (2019). The model is implemented using the Finite Element software Elmer/Ice (http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/). Results in the paper were calculated using the Elmer version 8.2 (Rev: a5adc1d), however more recent Elmer versions should work as well (see git repository of Elmer: https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem).

- This repository contains .sif files, mesh files, input data, solvers and user functions (USFs). Solvers and USFs in this repository are not available in the git repository of Elmer.

- Solvers and USFs must be compiled typing: "elmerf90 MySolver.F90 -o MySolver" (the same for USFs)

- For questions/comments please contact Carlo Licciulli (carlo.licciulli@badw.de), Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich, Germany.
